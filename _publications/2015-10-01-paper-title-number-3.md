excerpt: "This 5-year study compares the economic and animal performance outcomes of stocker cattle grazing systems using winter wheat and three tall fescue-based systems in south-central Oklahoma. Results show that while wheat systems produce greater total gain and gross revenue, tall fescue systems offer cost savings and comparable net returns, suggesting their viability as an alternative forage strategy."

This study evaluates the performance and profitability of stocker cattle grazing on four forage systems in Oklahoma:  
- (1) traditional winter wheat,  
- (2) two summer-dormant tall fescue systems fertilized with nitrogen (FLCH-N, CHSM-N), and  
- (3) a tall fescue system interseeded with alfalfa (FLALF).  

Using a 5-year field experiment, the analysis found:
- **Wheat systems** provided the highest total gain and gross revenue.
- **Tall fescue systems** significantly reduced total production costs.
- **Net returns** were statistically similar across systems (~$145/ha), highlighting the **economic viability of perennial systems**.

Sensitivity analysis revealed:
- The **FLALF system is less sensitive to fertilizer price increases**, offering stability in volatile input markets.
- Perennial systems may be **more resilient** in terms of net returns, particularly when fertilizer prices rise or cost-of-gain changes.
- Stand life assumptions significantly affect long-term profitabilityâ€”shorter stand lives favor the annual wheat system.

ðŸ“Œ This research suggests that while annual wheat remains the standard for stocker systems, tall fescue-based alternatives offer cost-effective, sustainable options that reduce reliance on synthetic nitrogen without sacrificing profitability.
