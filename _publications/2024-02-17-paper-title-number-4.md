This paper compares the economic viability of small-scale egg production using 1,000 birds across three systems: chickens with molting (CWM), chickens without molting (CNM), and quail. Using a ten-year cost-benefit simulation model, the study incorporates both farm gate and farmers’ market prices to evaluate profitability.

Key findings include:
- **Raising quail** yields the highest Net Present Value (NPV), regardless of price scenario.
- **Chicken production without molting** is more profitable than with molting, primarily due to reduced egg production during molting periods.
- All three systems are **profitable under farmers’ market prices**, but only **quail is viable under farm gate prices**.

The results underscore the importance of market access and production strategy for small-scale producers. While quail is the most financially promising, marketing challenges may limit adoption. This research offers valuable insights for producers, extension agents, and policy advocates promoting sustainable local agriculture.
