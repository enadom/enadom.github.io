Welcome! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Agricultural Economics at the University of Nevada, Reno. My work explores the economic impacts of climate change, drought adaptation, and land management practices in rural communities.

I earned my PhD in Agricultural Economics from Oklahoma State University, where I studied nitrogen management strategies in winter wheat production and the economics of prescribed fire and invasive species control.

My current research is part of the NSF-funded project *Where We Live*, which focuses on local and place-based climate adaptation in underserved rural communities across Nevada, Idaho, and South Carolina.

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students, and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to find data-driven solutions to real-world problems.

Check out my [CV](../files/cv.pdf), [publications](../publications/), and ongoing [projects](../research/).

Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
