Welcome!

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in Agricultural Economics at the University of Nevada, Reno. My work explores the economic impacts of climate change, drought adaptation, and land management practices in rural communities.

I earned my PhD in Agricultural Economics from Oklahoma State University, where I studied nitrogen management strategies in winter wheat production and the economics of prescribed fire and invasive species control.

My current research is part of the NSF-funded project *Where We Live*, which focuses on local and place-based climate adaptation in underserved rural communities across Nevada, Idaho, and South Carolina.

Outside of research, I enjoy teaching, mentoring students, and collaborating with interdisciplinary teams to find data-driven solutions to real-world problems.
