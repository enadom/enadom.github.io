Work experience
====== 
* **Graduate Research Associate**, Dept. of Agricultural Economics, Oklahoma State University — *Aug 2021–Present*  
  - Led the economic analysis for the RAIN project to increase nitrogen-use efficiency in rainfed systems.  
  - Integrated econometric methods with crop modeling (e.g., DSSAT) to optimize N recommendation systems.  
  - Simulated winter wheat growth under alternative N management scenarios.  
  - Collaborated with agronomists/soil scientists to align economic analyses with field observations.  
  - Conducted cost–benefit analyses of livestock enterprises.  
  - Presented results at conferences, workshops, and stakeholder meetings.

* **Graduate Research & Teaching Assistant**, Dept. of Agribusiness & Applied Economics, North Dakota State University — *Aug 2019–Jul 2021*  
  - Supported in-class and remote instruction.  
  - Performed extensive literature reviews and prepared research reports/manuscripts.  
  - Collaborated on research teams; presented findings at conferences.  
  - Analyzed data using R, SAS, and Stata.
